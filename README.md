# day-planner


A day planner made using Boostrap, Moment and Jquery UI

I decided to base the general design off of the accordion component in Bootstrap. The todo's are saved to local storage 
when the users clicks the button, then rendered on page refresh. I had fun exploring the bootstrap docs and am excited to see what 
I can create in the future.
